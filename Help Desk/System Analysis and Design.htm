The system will consist of two dedicated computers that are stationed at separate physical locations. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
The devices that will comprise the network can be accessed via the on-site workstations and the ethernet / 
wi-fi (routers) on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network ">Local Area Networks (LAN)</a>  
 as well as the internet. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
One device is the designated primary machine (the other device will continually be prepared to run the server software; In case of a 
system malfunction) which will host the website and allow access to the database - attached external 
storage. 
</p>


<p style="font-size:25px">
The design will be a unique variation of a Redundant Array of Independent / Inexpensive Disks 
(RAID) level configuration, which will ensure that the data will always be available and safe.
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
 The servers will be communicating constantly to update the customer, inventory and transaction data securely.
 All data will have several layers of security to protect it as well as encryption. 


<p style="font-size:25px">
The Administrator's workstation (laptop) will be programmed to synchronize with the server / database (all recent data changes), every log in. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
There will be three devices storing identical data simultaneously to prevent the complete loss 
of data and to protect the integrity of the data.
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
 The data will be validated at multiple points (input and 
update) with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions">hash</a>  and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum
">checksum </a> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"> algorithms</a>  ) as well as a transaction registry. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
There will be hardware 
failure processes and alerts to switch the servers in case of a malfunction as well as a strict protocol for any 
attempted data breaches; If an incorrect password is entered five times the devices will be programmed to 
lock out all network access (servers and storage) for 24 hours, unless it is from one of the physical on-site 
workstations. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
The back-up plan is to replace any hardware if / when a device fails and always be prepared to 
reconfigure the system.
