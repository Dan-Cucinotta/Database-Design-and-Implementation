The system will consist of several types of devices and equipment connected to a secure network, which will be established at two separate physical locations. Optimally designed with all new computer hardware and configured with a cost-free, open source operating system for the server and using only free, non-licensed, public domain software for encryption, security, server monitoring, firewall, etc., which will eliminate unnecessary recurring fees substantially. The computer hardware was chosen for its sufficient processing power as well as its moderate cost, portability and multi-use functionality. [The majority of the overall cost is invested initially in the quality of the hardware, yet, all are common devices which can be repurposed if necessary]. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
Several security features will be established - multiple levels on separate devices. A Redundant Array of Inexpensive/Independent Disks (RAID) configuration will be implemented with encrypted external storage for the safety, security and availability of the data/ information. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">
The servers will host the website and store all data/information from transactions on the system's local drive temporarily, until it is backed up daily to the external RAID drives, which will be located both sites. The devices will communicate frequently to ensure continuity. Checksum and hashing software will be utilized during all data exchanges to verify integrity (via intranet and internet).

<p style="font-size:25px">
The network will solely be connected through the ethernet ports for added protection against possible wireless router signal hacking, and remote access will only be allowed from a limited number of specific devices that will need the correct comprehensive login credentials.
